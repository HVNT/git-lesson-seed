# Let's learn git!  

### Why should you take this course?
Ok, so you've finished your first Computer Science class at Georgia Tech. You understand how to write a simple program, compile it, and then run it. Congradulations, you're a coder. Things are about to get interesting for you. Now that you understand can write some code that actually does some thing it's time to take it to the next level, working on a team. Working on a team introduces new challenges. The biggest challenge your team will face will probably be not implementing the code itself, but how to implement the code in a distributed manner where everyone is contributing to one central project. This course will teach you just that: how to contribute your code in a organized scalable manner to a team project.

### What is version control?
Version Control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. Think a really lightweight "OS X" bootcamp for your CS projects. It allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back toa  previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and much more.

### What is git?
Git is a Version Control System. There are many Version Control Systems out there, git is just one of them. We are teaching git because we feel like it has been accepted by the software community as the best practice Version Control System. Lately, we've even seen recruiters talk as if it's a requirement to any Computer Science graduate's resume.

### What is GitHub?
Git is great, but we need a put our project that everyone can access: AKA the internet. There are a lot of great services out there that provide this ability. For this course, we will use GitHub. We chose GitHub because, like git, we feel like it has been accepted by the software community as the best practice hosting site for projects under git Version Control.

### Ok now that we are through all of that, lets finally get our hands dirty and beafin' up that resume.  

### Step 1: Installing git. 
To get started, we need to make sure you have git installed on your Operating System. If already have git installed you can skip this step and continue to Step 2.  
Go to https://git-scm.com/downloads and download the appropriate git for your Operating System.  
Once you have the .img or .exe (OS X or Windows, respectively), go ahead and click the file to run it. Follow the instructions and install git.  
You can confirm you have git by opening up your terminal (or window prompt) and entering the command 'git help'.  
Once you have confirmed git is installed continue to Step 2.

### Step 2: Getting started.
The command 'git help' you ran in Step 1 ran the 'help' function in git using gits command-line interface (CLI). A CLI is simply a text based interface that you most commonly interact with through your command line (i.e. your terminal or window prompt). A CLI is just a way to interact with an underlying program, the same way your clicking the 'refresh' button on your browser interacts with it's underlying program. An interface of any time is simply a means for a program to digest user input. You can now continue to Step 3.

### Step 3: Making your first git project.
Now that you know what git is and how to interface with it via the command line, lets make your first git repository.  
Go ahead and make a new folder wherever you'd like (your desktop might be easiest, but it doesn't matter) and open your command prompt and navigate to it (using the command cd). Once you are in the folder inside your command prompt, go ahead and make your first git repository using the command 'git init'. There should now be a .git directory in the folder you created if you followed the steps correctly. If this is the case, continue to Step 4. 

### Step 4: Making your first GitHub repository.

### Step 5: Making your first git commit.

### Step 6: Pushing your first commit to GitHub.

### Step 7: Making your first branch.

### Step 8: Making a change on your branch.

### Step 9: Pushing your branch to your GitHub repository

### Step 10: Making your first pull request and merging it into master.
