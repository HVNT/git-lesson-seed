# Let's learn git!  

### Why should you take this course?
Ok, so you've finished your first Computer Science class at Georgia Tech. You understand how to write a simple program, compile it, and then run it. Congradulations, you're a coder. Things are about to get interesting for you. Now that you understand can write some code that actually does some thing it's time to take it to the next level, working on a team. Working on a team introduces new challenges. The biggest challenge your team will face will probably be not implementing the code itself, but how to implement the code in a distributed manner where everyone is contributing to one central project. This course will teach you just that: how to contribute your code in a organized scalable manner to a team project.

### What is version control?
Version Control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. Think a really lightweight "OS X" bootcamp for your CS projects. It allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back toa  previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and much more.

### What is git?
Git is a Version Control System. There are many Version Control Systems out there, git is just one of them. We are teaching git because we feel like it has been accepted by the majority of the software industry as the best practice Version Control System. Lately, we've seen recruiters talk as if it's a requirement to any Computer Science graduate's resume.

## Ok now that we are through all of that, lets finally get our hands dirty and beafin' up that resume.
